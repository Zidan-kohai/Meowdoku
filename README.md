# Meowdoku
## A Sudoku Android App
Programmed in C# and developed using the Unity Engine and soon to be avaliable for download on Android, Meowdoku is a fun cute sudoku game with cat themed UI elements and animations. 
Every element of the UI was hand-drawn. Animations done by hand frame-by-frame. All assets are original, made by me (Kaylee Nasser).

Sudoku background music created by AstroForte.
