# Sudoku
My favourite game :)
Right now this is just a command line game where you call on sudoku.py and play the game by entering the rows and columns you want to place numbers in. I will be translating this python code to C#, and hopefully will be implementing an animated and aesthetically pleasing sudoku game in unity. For now, enjoy command line game!
